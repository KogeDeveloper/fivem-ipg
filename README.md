# This script uses the requests library to make a GET request to the FiveM server API and retrieve the server information in JSON format. It then parses the JSON data to extract the IP address of the server, which is printed to the console.

Note: If the server is not online or not exist in the api, it will give error message "An error occurred while trying to retrieve the server information."
